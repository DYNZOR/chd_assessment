# Coronary Heart Disease Risk Assessment using Fuzzy Logic

Master's Fuzzy Logic assignment on the assessment of the risk that patients are of coronary heart disease (CHD). 
A report on the assigment is provided. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To view the fuzzy inference system created, access to either FuzzyLite or Matlab is required. The files of interest reside within the "fuzzylite" and "matlab" directories within "fis".  

## Built With

* [QT FuzzyLite 6](https://fuzzylite.com/) - Main FuzzyLite library used for construction the system. 

* [Matlab] - Fuzzy logic system visualization. 

## Desirable Improvements to Assignment 

* Acquire more data.
* More well-rounded exploratory data analysis stage. 
* Experiment with Type-2 Fuzzy Logic. 
* Implement an Adaptive-Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) which involves the use of supervised learning to acquire the parameters that define the fuzzy sets and rulebase.
